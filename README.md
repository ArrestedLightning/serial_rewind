# serial_rewind
This project provides an internal serial port to certain PowerPC Macintosh computers that shipped without one built in.  This is accomplished by replacing the internal modem, similar to the GeeThree StealthPort, the Griffin gPort, and Alex Hixon's Jamport.

More documentation coming soon!
