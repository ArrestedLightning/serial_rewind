# Serial Rewind

![Serial Rewind Logo](https://github.com/ArrestedLightning/serial_rewind/blob/main/docs/Logo2.svg)

This project provides an internal serial port to certain PowerPC Macintosh computers that shipped without one built in.  This is accomplished by replacing the internal modem, similar to the GeeThree StealthPort, the Griffin gPort, and Alex Hixon's Jamport.

This project is a work-in-progress.  Any use of the files here is at your own risk.

The goal is to support most PowerPC G3 and G4 machines.  See the README file in the hardware directory for more information on the status of each variant.
