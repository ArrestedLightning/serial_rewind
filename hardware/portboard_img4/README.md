# Portboard IMG4

This is a simple breakout board designed specifically for the iMac G4.  As far as I know, the iMac G4 is the only machine which used this form factor modem port board.  This board was designed based on measurements from an original board, but has not yet been fit-tested in an actual machine.  I can therefore make no guarantees about its usability.
