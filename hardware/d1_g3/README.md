# "Dash 1" main board

This is the main board for systems which use a "Dash 1" modem board.  As far as I know, this is only the tray-load iMac G3, the Blue & White Power Mac G3, and the PCI Graphics Power Mac G4.  All of these machines have the port integrated in the main board, so a port breakout board is not required.  However, the tower systems will probably require an extension board of some kind to connect to the logic board.

This board is very much a work in progress.  I have not currently done much on it yet beyond measuring the outline used for the port mounting face on the iMac G3.  However, I do have a modem to reverse engineer and machine to test with; the plan is still to finish this at some point.
